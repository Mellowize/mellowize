# Payload HTMX Stack

## Overview
Payload HTMX Stack is a proof of concept for a Payload CMS Website using HTMX and Server Side JSX. This project aims to provide a simplified stack for web development, leveraging the power of Payload CMS, HTMX, and other technologies.

## Description
This project is currently in [state of development], featuring [mention key features or components]. Please be aware of any existing limitations.

## Driving Principles
- **Simplicity:** The goal is to create a stack that is easy to use and understand, avoiding black magic or special syntax.
- **Developer Experience:** In the pursuit of simplicity, I wanted to make sure that the developer experience was not compromised. One of the big hurdles was making sure that templating would have auto complete and be type safe. Most major template engines for express do not support this. I adopted JSX and wrote our own templating engine based on React Dom Server Api to achieve this.
